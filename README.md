# Expand, Highlight, Generate: RL-Driven Document Generation for Passage Reranking

This repository contains the official code for the EMNLP 2023 paper, "Expand, Highlight, Generate: RL-Driven Document Generation for Passage Reranking," which has been accepted at the main track of EMNLP 2023.

## DocGen: (1) Expand, (2) Highlight, (3) Generate

Explore the capabilities of our DocGen pipeline by running [`EMNLP23-ChatGPT-RetrievalQA-Document-Generator-Demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/arian-askari/docgen/blob/main/src/EMNLP23_ChatGPT_RetrievalQA_Document_Generator_Demo.ipynb). This notebook provides an example of the DocGen pipeline, showcasing the following steps:
1. Expanding a query.
2. Highlighting its tokens.
3. Generating a synthetic document.

Furhtermore, we provide example of experimenting with different highlighting tokens such as "<>", "*", "()".

## Generated Data

Check out the generated data, including synthetic expanded queries, highlighted queries, and generated documents, by exploring the `generated_data` directory.
